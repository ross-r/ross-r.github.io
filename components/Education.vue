    I started my education journey through Open Universities Australia in 2017
    and began study with RMIT Universities, in 2017 I completed my introduction
    courses to become eligable for a Bachelors in Information Technology.

    In 2020 I enrolled in the Bachelors Degree and began my studies full time, however,
    due to circumstances I decided to withdraw from my studies towards the end of 2021.

    During my time studying, I completed the following courses:

  <ul class="pt-4 ps-4 pb-4 list-disc">
    <li>User-Centred Design (RMI-CPT112 | 2020) (D)</li>
    <li>Introduction to Computer Systems (RMI-CPT160 | 2020) (HD)</li>
    <li>Programming 1 (RMI-CPT121 | 2021) (HD)</li>
    <li>Building IT Systems (RMI-CPT111 | 2021) (HD)</li>
    <li>Web Programming (RMI-CPT270 | 2021) (HD)</li>
    <li>Database Concepts (RMI-CPT140 | 2021) (C)</li>
    <li>Software Engineering Fundamentals (RMI-CPT230 | 2021) (P)</li>

  </ul>

  Unfortunately towards the tail end of 2021 I had some circumstances which affected my education.
